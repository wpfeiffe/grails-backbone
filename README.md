grails-backbone
===============

This project serves as a example project demonstrating use of backbone.js,
require.js and underscore.js for templating in a grails webapp.  Grails is
used to provide the JSON/REST api.


Database
--------
The project uses postgresql as its db but I left the h2 config in comments to
easily go back to the grails defaults.
